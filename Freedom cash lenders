Freedom cash lenders

A payday loan is a high-cost, short-term loan for a small amount — typically $500 or less — that’s meant to be repaid with the borrower's next paycheck. Payday loans require only proof of identification, income and a bank account and are often made to people who have bad or nonexistent credit.

Financial experts caution against payday loans — particularly if there’s any chance the borrower can't repay the loan — and recommend alternative lending sources instead. (See the alternatives section at the end.)
