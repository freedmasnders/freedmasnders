Payday loans typically cost $10 to $30 for every $100 borrowed, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

. If you borrow $100, and the fee is $15 for every $100 borrowed, your total repayment will be $115.

If you don’t repay the loan in full on the due date, the lender may add a fee to extend the due date

. If this cycle repeats, borrowers can end up owing more in interest than the original loan amount.

That’s why payday loans are risky — it's easy to get trapped in a cycle of debt and expensive to get out.
